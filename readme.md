The template could not be downloaded from your link, indicated several different mails, the letter with the link has not yet been received, found the same source code on another site, downloaded from here - https://www.bypeople.com/html-scss-website-template /

There was also a ready-made template, but I did not use it, I wrote from scratch, you can compare the code.

The task was given to me in the area of ​​lunch 3.02, I began to think about what I can do in 2 days (the maximum period that is given for the test task)
As a result, I decided to do what I have time without paying attention to:

- pixel perfect
- crossbrowser support
- semantics
- validation
- optimization
- arias
- BEM
- commenting

There were no pictures in the template (Note: All pictures are used for demo purposes solely, they’re not added within the download package.), So I found several on unsplash and added to the template to make it look nicer, I didn’t bother much.
You can see in the folder - the source

Unfortunately, I did not have much time, I was in a hurry, so I was not happy with the result, but this is my maximum that can be done in 2 days from scratch.
